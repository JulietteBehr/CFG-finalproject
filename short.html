              <P>Approx time: 1 hour</P>
              <P>Start point: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ywbNxKFazy7YnC6U6", target="blank">Holyrood Park Road</a></P>
              <P>Head through the gates into Holyrood Park and follow the path to the roundabout. Turn left and up towards the second roundabout, with The Salisbury Crags facing you, and turn left again. From here you are pretty much following the path all the way around.
                <P>Follow the path sloping downwards around The Crags. At the bottom of the hill you'll pass Dynamic Earth, The Scottish Parliament, and Holyrood Palace on your left.
                <P>A little further along, you'll notice the ruins of St Anthony's Chapel up the hill to your right. If you fancy a little detour, head up to the ruins for great views over the loch.
                <P>You'll then come to St Margaret's Loch. At the end of the loch, keep on Queen's Drive and follow the road up the hill.
                <P>The incline is steep, but not too long, and at the top of the hill you'll find Dunsapie Loch.
                <P>Shortly after here you'll be rewarded with some stunning views out over the East and South of Edinburgh. On a clear day you should be able to see all the way to the Pentland Hills and the Bass Rock.
                <P>Continue along the road and you'll start to head downhill, eventually coming back to the roundabouts in front of The Crags.

           <P>Start point: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/3Qk5QLeEGr59Rusr8" target="blank">Belford Bridge</a></P>
           <P>Head down the steps from Belford Bridge and onto the Water of Leith path.</P>
           <P>Follow the path downriver, taking you past the weir and into the Dean Village. Continue along the path, under the impressive Dean Bridge and past St Bernard's Well.</P>
           <P>Once you reach Stockbridge, you'll need to come off the path again and rejoin it on the other side of the bridge. Turn left at the crossroads, cross the bridge, and take the steps down. If you're here on a Sunday, maybe make a stop at the Stockbridge Market.</P>
           <P>After a short while, you'll need to come off the main path again. Signs will point you in the right direction, and you'll rejoin the path just up the road taking you through a lovely forest-like part of the walk.</P>
           <P>When you reach Cannonmills, some steps will take you up on to the road. Cross at the traffic lights and you'll be back on the path.</P>
            <P>From here, you'll stay on the path all the way down to The Shore, where the Water of Leith comes out into the sea.</P>

            <P>Join the path just off the main road that leads down towards the beach.</P>
            <P>Continue along the promenade, or walk along the beach if you like to get your feet in the sand!</P>
            <P>When you reach the end of the promenade, enjoy the beautiful views looking back along the beach. There is easy public transport from here, or else walk back along to where you started.</P>
