              <P>Approx time: 2 hours</P>
              <P>Start point: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/X3ULxPmQ669NzdvH6", target="blank">Granton Beach</a></P>
              <P>CAUTION: It is only possible to walk out to Cramond Island when the tide is out. Please check tide times and be mindful of these if heading out.</P>
              <P>It's easy to access Cramond from the car park near the island, but for a longer walk and some beautiful scenery I like to start at the other end of path and head all the way along the sea front first.</P>
              <P>Walk along the coastal path all the way to the end, when you'll see the causeway path to your right. Head out along the causeway to reach the island.</P>
                <P>The island is small, and exploring it won't take long, but there are old WW2 ruins dotted about the island which are well worth checking out.</P>
                <P>Keep an eye on the time and make sure to head back with plenty to spare before the tide starts to come in, as it can rise much quicker than expected!</P>

           <P>Start point: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/2noeLgUhM2F4g1ZS7" target="blank">Threipmuir Reservoir Car Park</a></P>
            <P>From the car park head towards Threipmuir Reservour, keeping it on your right. Continue past Harlaw Reservoir and past the visitor centre, then turn right. Follow the path along until you reach a gate on your right, near the Harlaw Car Park.</P>
            <P>Go through the gate and continue straight ahead, then take the left fork in the path across the hills. Keep heading in this direction (and enjoy the stunning views) and you will eventually intersect the road which runs around Glencorse Reservoir.</P>
            <P>Turn right along the road and follow alongside the reservoir, at the end of which the path will continue alongside a burn, then take you to Loganlea Reservoir.</P>
            <P>From here the path begins to curve around to the right, taking you past a small waterfall before going back up into the hills. Eventually you'll cross some more open fields, on the other side of which a gate will take you on the a road and back across Threipmuir Reservoir to the Car Park.</P>

            <div class="walkContent">
              <P>Approx time: 3 hours</P>
            <P>Start point: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/rfwVknQwSwKkmA8B8" target="blank">Haymarket Station</a></P>
            <P>From Haymarket Station, follow the tram tracks away from town as they curve away from the main road, then take the first road on your right running parallel to the train tracks. Keep to the pedestrian path which will take you around beside some houses, and eventully join up to the cycle path sloping up to your left.</P>
            <P>Walk along the cycle path until you reach a fork in the path, and take the left side. For most of this route, you'll be following National Cycle Route 1, so look out for the red 1 on the blue signs to keep you right.</P>
            <P>The next fork in the path you come to (with Silverknowles Road on your right), take the left fork which will take you out beside Tesco, turn right then take the first left. Again, the National Cycle Route 1 signs will show the way to go. Follow Barnton Avenue round to the right. When you come to Whitehouse Road, cross over and keep going straight ahead. You'll come to the River Almond and cross the bridge.</P>
            <P>Keep following the path alongside the road, and you will eventually come to the entrance to the Dalmeny Estate. Keep to the main road through the estate, which will lead you to Dalmeny House. Keep to the right of it and keep going along the path into the woods.</P>
            <P>From here it is straight along the main path (or cut through the trees and walk along the beach), all the way to South Queensferry. Head along the main street for plenty of places to stop for something to eat, just enjoy the views, or keep going until you reach Shore Road to catch a bus back into town.</P>
