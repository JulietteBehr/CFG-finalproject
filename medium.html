              <P>Head into the tunnel and continue along the path which will take you along beside Arthur's Seat.</P>
              <P>Keep to the path until you reach Jewel Park, and from there follow the river</P>
              <P>When you reach the underpass, turn left and eventually come on to Milton Road. Follow this down towards the sea.</P>
              <P>Turn right at the bottom of the main road, and continue along the road. You can join the footpath that runs parallel instead of being beside the road.</P>
              <P>Keep to the path by the sea, which will take you round the corner and up the river. Cross the second bridge you come to and you'll find yourself in Musselburgh town centre. </P>

            <P>From the bottom of Morningside Road, head up Braid Road and continue until you reach the Braid Hills Trail path on your left.</P>
            <P>When you reach a fork in the path, take the right side going upwards. After a short climb you'll reach the Seven Hills Viewpoint, with amazing view across the city.</P>
            <P>Continue along the path, which will loop around to the left alongside the golf course and then parallel to the main road. </P>
            <P>At the end of the path, go through the gate and cross the road, into the Hermitage of Braid. Follow the path down, cross the bridge at the bottom over the Braid Burn, and head left.</P>
            <P>There are lots of paths through the Hermitage, stick to the main one or head onto one of the others - they'll all end up in the same place eventually! When you reach the end, you'll be back on the Braid Road and it's just a bit further down the road until you're back where you started.</P>

              <P>From the canal basin, stick to the canal path until you hit the aquaduct over the Water of Leith. Take the steps down to the right, and head left under the bridge.</P>
              <P>Cross the road and rejoin the Water of Leith Walkway on the other side.</P>
              <P>Keep to the path and follow the river. Eventually you will arrive at the Colinton Tunnel, which has been painted with murals all the way along. When you come out of the tunnel, take the steps up the right onto the main road.</P>
